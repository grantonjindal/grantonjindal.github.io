During my postdoc, I was Instructor of Record for the "Advanced Topics in Modern Biology: Evolutionary Developmental Biology" undergraduate class. I designed and taught this upper-level undergraduate discussion-based course two times during Summer Session 2023. We covered papers with various model systems, a diversity of authors, and a diversity of study locations.
