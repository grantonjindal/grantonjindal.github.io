During my postdoc, I was Instructor of Record for the "Advanced Topics in Modern Biology: Evolutionary Developmental Biology" undergraduate class. I designed and taught this upper-level undergraduate discussion-based course two times during Summer Session 2023. We covered nine papers using various model systems, authored by diverse scientists, and with studies taking place in various locations around the world.
