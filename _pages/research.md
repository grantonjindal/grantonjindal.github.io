## Transcriptional enhancers in embryonic development
![Foxf enhancer expression in development](https://grantonjindal.github.io/images/Foxf2.PNG)


I am currently studying how the Foxf cardiopharyngeal enhancer in *Ciona robusta* encodes precise tissue-specific expression.

## Analyzing pathogenic MEK1 mutations in embryonic development

I demonstrated a ranking of MEK1 mutations found in RASopathies, which are a group of human developmental disorders, using functional assays in the embryonic zebrafish.

## Labeling proteins with non-canonical amino acids
![Using mutant tRNA synthetase to incorporate ANL](https://grantonjindal.github.io/images/MetANL.gif)


I assisted in describing a mutant murine methionyl-tRNA-synthetase that charges the noncanonical amino acid azidonorleucine to elongator tRNA<sup>Met</sup> in hamster (CHO), monkey (COS7), and human (HeLa) cell lines.
