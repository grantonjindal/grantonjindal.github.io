## Transcriptional enhancers in embryonic development

I am currently studying how the Foxf heart enhancer in Ciona robusta encodes precise tissue-specific expression.

## Analyzing pathogenic MEK1 mutations in embryonic development

I demonstrated a ranking of MEK1 mutations found in RASopathies, human developmental disorders, using functional assays in the embryonic zebrafish.

## Labeling proteins with non-canonical amino acids

Assisted in describing a mutant murine methionyl-tRNA-synthetase that charges the noncanonical amino acid azidonorleucine to elongator tRNA<sup>Met</sup> in hamster (CHO), monkey (COS7), and human (HeLA) cell lines.
